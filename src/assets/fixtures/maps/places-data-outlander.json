It sits at the top of the historic Royal Mile on a volcanic plug, and is perhaps the most famous landmark on the Edinburgh skyline. Beat the crowds and get there for opening at 9.30am. The views over the city are pretty spectacular, and there is so much to take in, including the National Museum of War, the National War Monument and the Honours of Scotland, the county's Crown Jewels.",
